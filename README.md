Last modified: 02/21/24

Euthymia Technologies (“we”) respect your privacy and are committed to protecting it by complying with this policy.

This policy describes:

* The types of information we may collect or that app users (“you”) may provide when you download, install, or use FluidMind (the “App”).
* Our practices for collecting, using, maintaining, protecting, and disclosing that information.

We will only use your personal information in accordance with this policy unless otherwise required by applicable law. We take steps to ensure that the personal information that we collect about you is adequate, relevant, not excessive, and used for limited purposes.

Privacy laws in Canada generally define “personal information" as any information about an identifiable individual, which includes information that can be used on its own or with other information to identify, contact, or locate a single person.

This policy applies only to information we collect in this App, and other electronic communications sent through or in connection with this App.

This policy DOES NOT apply to information that:

* We collect offline or on any other Euthymia Technologies app, including websites you may access through this App.
* You provide to or is collected by any third party.

These third parties may have their own privacy policies, which we encourage you to read before providing information on or through them.

Please read this policy carefully to understand our policies and practices for collecting, processing, and storing your information. If you do not agree with our policies and practices, **do not download or use this App**. By downloading or using this App, you indicate that you understand, accept, and consent to the practices described in this privacy policy. This policy may change from time to time. Your continued use of this App after we make changes indicates that you accept and consent to those changes, so please check the policy periodically for updates. We will notify you in advance of any material changes to this policy and obtain your consent to any new ways that we collect, use, and disclose your personal information.

### INFORMATION WE COLLECT ABOUT YOU AND HOW WE COLLECT IT

We collect information about you through:

* Direct interactions with you when you provide it to us, such as by corresponding with us.
* Automated technologies or interactions, when you use the App, for example, usage details, IP addresses, and information collected through cookies, and other tracking technologies.

The types of information that we collect include:

* <u>Personal information</u> that we can reasonably use to directly or indirectly identify you, such as your name, email address, telephone number, internet protocol (IP) address, and any other identifier we may use to contact you.
* <u>Non-personal information</u> that does not directly or indirectly reveal your identity or directly relate to an identified individual, such as demographic, statistical, or aggregated information. We may derive non-personal statistical or aggregated data from personal information. For example, we may aggregate personal information to calculate the percentage of users accessing a specific app feature.
* <u>Technical information</u>, including your device type, time zone setting, and usage details.

***Information You Provide to Us***

When you download or use this App, we may ask you to provide:

***Automated Information Collection and Tracking Technologies***

When you download, access, and use the App, it may automatically collect:

* <u>Usage details</u>: When you access and use the App, we may automatically collect certain details of your access to and use of the App, including traffic data, location data, logs, and other communication data and the resources that you can access and use on or through the App.
* <u>Device information</u>: We may collect information about your mobile device and internet connection, including the device’s unique identifier, IP address, operating system, browser type, and mobile network information.
* <u>Location information</u>: This App does not collect real-time information about the location of your device.

The technologies we use for this automatic data collection may include:

* <u>Mobile cookies</u>: A cookie is a small file placed on your smartphone. It may be possible to refuse to accept mobile cookies by activating the appropriate setting on your smartphone. However, if you select this setting, you may be unable to access certain parts of our App.
* <u>Web beacons</u>: Pages of the App and our emails may contain small electronic files known as web beacons that permit Euthymia Technologies, for example, to count users who have visited those pages or for other related App statistics.

The information we collect automatically is statistical and does not include personal information. We may maintain it or associate it with personal information we collect in other ways, that you provide to us or receive from third parties. This usage information helps us to improve our App and deliver a more personalized service, including by helping us to:

* Estimate our audience size and usage patterns.
* Recognize you when you use the App.

In addition to helping advertisers reach the right people for their products and services, behavioural advertising helps support the App so that you can enjoy free content.

We may process, store, and transfer your personal information in and to other countries with different privacy laws that may not be as comprehensive as Canadian law.

Whenever we engage a service provider, we require that its privacy and security standards comply with this policy and applicable Canadian laws.

By submitting your personal information or engaging with the App, you consent to this transfer, storage, or processing.

### DATA SECURITY

The security of your personal information is of utmost importance to us. We use physical, electronic, and administrative measures designed to secure your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration, and disclosure. We store all information you provide to us behind firewalls on our secure servers.

Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the Internet and mobile platforms is not completely secure. Although we do our best to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information transmitted through the App. Any transmission of personal information is at your own risk. We are not responsible for circumvention of any App privacy settings or security measures.

### DATA RETENTION

Except as otherwise permitted or required by applicable law or regulation, we will only retain your personal information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes we have collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements. Under some circumstances we may anonymize or aggregate your personal information so that it can no longer be associated with you. We reserve the right to use such anonymous and de-identified data for any legitimate business purpose without further notice to you or your consent.

### MINORS UNDER THE AGE OF MAJORITY

Our App is not intended for minors under the age of majority in the province or territory of Canada in which they reside. No one under the age of majority in the jurisdiction in which they reside may provide any personal information to or on the App. We do not knowingly collect personal information from minors under the age of majority. If you are under the age of majority, do not use or provide any information on this App or on or through any of its features on the App, or provide any information about yourself to us, including your name, address, telephone number, or email address.

Applicable law may allow or require us to refuse to provide you with access to some or all of the personal information that we hold about you, or we may have destroyed, erased, or made your personal information anonymous in accordance with our record retention obligations and practices.
